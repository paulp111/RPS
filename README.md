## Rock, Paper, Scissors game 

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in JavaScript. You can play it against the computer, which chooses completly random.
To play the game, open the rps.html file in a web browser. You can click on one of the 3 buttons to choose from either rock, paper or scissors. Either who reaches 5 win-points first wins, an alert then pops up and it will be resetted. Draw doesn't count as anything.

spielRunde(spieler, computer): This function checks who won the round.
resetRPS(): This function resets the game after somebody wins it.
spielerAuswahl(auswahl): when the player makes a move, it checks who won, how many points and if the game is already over then.
